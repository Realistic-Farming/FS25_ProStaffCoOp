# ProStaffCoOp Disease Flush battery: the scout names the acting farm
# (src/ProStaffDiseaseFlush.lua _sfTreat). Rows live in disease_flush_test.lua, whose
# SF stub models SoilFertilizer #998 (scoutField refuses a farm without standing and
# the report carries no recommendation until discovered).
#
# KILLED* means killed only by a Lua error: a weak kill, treated as a failure.
#
# Anchors are written with "\n"; in a CRLF file they are matched as "\r\n". Every
# mutation is proven landed (anchor count asserted, the written bytes re-read).
#
# RUN IT ALONE, through the test lock. A battery edits production files in place.
#
# Usage: py tools/test/mutate_prostaff_flush.py [id-prefix ...]
