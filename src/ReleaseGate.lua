-- =========================================================
-- FS25_ProStaffCoOp - Release Gate
-- =========================================================
-- The release gate: which systems are released (STABLE) vs experimental (LOCKED).
--
-- Orthogonal to difficulty. Difficulty answers how punishing a PROVEN system is;
-- the release gate answers whether an UNPROVEN system runs at all. The gate is its
-- own explicit opt-in (experimental systems, on at your own risk), independent of
-- difficulty, and the two locks STACK.
--
-- The lock set and the rule that generates it come from Arissani's certification
-- (2026-08-03, ledger): a system earns STABLE only when built AND observed in a
-- real save, its player surface exists and shows what it does, its known
-- high/blocking defects are closed, and it is balance-safe. Fail any one and it
-- stays LOCKED. Releasing a system for a stable release is a deliberate act,
-- never a default.
-- =========================================================

-- The certified experimental (LOCKED) set. Each entry: [systemId] = { name, status }.
